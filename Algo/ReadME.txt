Stacks

// The last book you put on the stack will be the first book you take off

stack.push ==> adding item to the stack
stack.pop ==>  to remove the top or last elt of the stack
stack.length ==>  to determine how many elements are on the stack

Array as a stack

// Sets

In ES6, size is not a function. it is a property, so there won't be parenthesis when it is called

// Queues

The queue data structure is a way to hold data.
first in first out---> like the first person in the queue leaves . 
 another example is when sending data to be printed to a printer
